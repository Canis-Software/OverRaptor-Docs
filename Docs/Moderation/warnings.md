# Warn players

Warnings give the opportunity to notify a player they have broken one of your rules, both allowing the behaviour of players to be monitored and giving a chance for the player to ammend their behaviour.

### Give warning
Warn the player. This will notify them if they are online they have been given a warning. If the user disconnects from the game they will be able to see their latest warning when next logging in.
```
warn [alderon_id] [reason] 
```

### Remove warning
The warning ID can be found by running the `/player-info` command.
```
remove-warn [warning_id]
```
